In this workshop, we’ll teach the essential elements of answering causal questions in R through causal diagrams, and causal modeling techniques such as propensity scores and inverse probability weighting. We’ll also show that by distinguishing predictive models from causal models, we can better take advantage of both tools.

In R, the fundamental unit of reusable code is a package, containing helpful functions, documentation, and sometimes sample data. This workshop will teach you the fundamentals of package development in R, using tools and principles developed and used extensively by the tidyverse team - specifically the ‘devtools’ family of packages including usethis, testthat, and roxygen2. These packages and workflows help you focus on the contents of your package rather than the minutiae of package structure. \nYou will learn the structure of a package, how to organize your code, and workflows to help you develop your package iteratively. You will learn how to write good documentation so that users can learn how to use your package, and how to use automated testing to ensure it is functioning the way you expect it to, now and into the future. You will also learn how to check your package for common problems, and how to distribute your package for others to use.\nThis will be an interactive 1-day workshop, and we will be using the RStudio IDE to work through the materials, as it has been designed to work well with the development practices we will be featuring.\n\n\nAudience\nThis workshop is for you if:\n\nYou have written several R scripts and find yourself wondering how to reuse or share the code you’ve written;\nYou know how to write functions in R\nYou are looking for a way to take the next step in your R programming journey\n\nWe will be demonstrating some workflows using Git and GitHub. Knowledge of these tools is not required, and you will absolutely be able to complete the workshop without them, but some of the lessons will be more rewarding to you if you are prepared to try them out.

    "text": "Description\nR is a tool for data analysis, but also can be used for self expression. This workshop will be an introduction to creative coding in R in order to make visual art. We will take an inspiration-first approach, using compelling pieces to discuss and learn the techniques that shape the work. This workshop takes guidance from its namesake, the book “Steal Like An Artist” by Austin Kleon - once we have identified and learned to recreate existing works, we will cover how to take this inspiration and transform, remix, or reinterpret it in the pursuit of developing our own work and artistic styles. \n\nThis workshop is hands on and will cover colour theory and manipulation, a reintroduction of the data frame as the foundation for creating art (instead of just for analyzing data!), using ggplot2 as an artistic canvas, creating basic and specialized shapes, tiling and pattern making, developing your own functions and using iteration. We will also discuss how to use controlled randomness to convert a standalone piece into a generative art system that can produce many distinct outputs. Creative coding may seem a world apart from data analysis, but we see a large overlap and intersection of the skills used in both, not to mention the creative muscles that are already used in data visualization.\n\n\nAudience\nThis workshop is for you if you:\n\nare comfortable with R and RStudio, experience with tidyverse and ggplot2,\nare interested in applying data visualization skills more creatively, but may not know where to start or how to develop style/inspiration, and\nare an artist interested in exploring code as another medium for creating their work,\n\n\n\nInstructors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIjeamaka Anyene Fumagalli is a full-time senior data analyst in the healthcare space and a free time computational artist. Using code, mainly the R programming language, she creates data art and generative art systems. She loves all things grid based, minimal, and geometric which naturally led to her love for textile arts as well.\n\n\n\n\nSharla Gelfand is a freelance statistician, software developer, and artist with interests in web development, generative art, and textile arts. Their work explores the play between art created by a computer and by hand, creating generative art that looks like it could have been made by hand (like a textile, drawing, or painting), and making physical art based on data or outputs of a generative system, exploring the strengths and limitations of each."

    "text": "Description\nShiny brings tremendous possibilities to share innovative data science workflows with others inside an intuitive web interface. Many in the Shiny community have shared effective development techniques for building a robust application. Even with the best intentions during application development, a myriad of issues can arise once it leaves the confines of your machine.  In this one-day workshop, you will implement core techniques to account for common scenarios that arise once your application is used in production, such as accounting for thousands of simultaneous users, how effective profiling can address performance bottlenecks, and ensuring your application is doing as little as possible to ensure a smooth and responsive experience.  \n\n\nAudience\nThis course assumes intermediate knowledge of building Shiny applications in R and prior experience deploying an application to a platform such as the shinyapps.io service or products like Posit Connect.\nThis course is for you if you:\n\nhad a Shiny application work just fine on your machine, but encounters critical issues after deployment,\nare eager to prospectively apply techniques before deployment to plan for the unexpected, and\nwant to know the benefits and trade-offs between various ways of hosting Shiny applications.\n\n\n\nInstructors\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEric Nantz is a director within the statistical innovation center at Eli Lilly and Company, creating analytical pipelines and capabilities of advanced statistical methodologies for clinical design used in multiple phases of development. Outside of his day job, Eric is passionate about connecting with and showcasing the brilliant R community in multiple ways. You may recognize his voice from the R-Podcast that he launched in 2012. Eric is also the creator of the Shiny Developer Series where he interviews authors of Shiny-related packages and practitioners developing applications, as well as sharing his own R and Shiny adventures via live streams on his Twitch channel. In addition, Eric is a curator for the RWeekly project and co-host of the RWeekly Highlights podcast which accompanies every issue.\n\n\n\n\nMike Thomas is the Chief Data Scientist at Ketchbrook Analytics. He holds a B.S. in Accounting and Mathematics from Stonehill College, and an M.S. in Business Intelligence & Analytics from Saint Joseph’s University. He specializes in architecting and executing end-to-end data science solutions, which often culminate in the development of a Shiny web application. Michael is a Posit-certified trainer in both Tidyverse and Shiny, and he co-hosts the R Weekly Highlights podcast. He enjoys developing Shiny apps that benefit his local community and beyond."
