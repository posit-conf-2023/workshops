# Abstract

Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R.
This workshop will start at the beginning: designing and creating user interfaces, learning and mastering the reactive model that connects your R code to the interface, and deploying apps publicly and privately.
We will wrap up with some intermediate-level tools: debugging and modularizing your apps and implementing dynamic user iterfaces.
In the end, you'll be a confident Shiny user, able to design interactive apps to achieve your purpose and produce a polished and professional implementation.

# Target audience

This course is for you if:

-   you are comfortable with the basics of R, such as writing functions, indexing vectors and lists, debugging simple errors, and working with data structures like data frames.
-   you ...
-   you ...

Your (lack of) previous experience with Shiny is not an issue.
If you have experience, you'll see things in a new way.
If you don't, we'll get you started on the right footing.
